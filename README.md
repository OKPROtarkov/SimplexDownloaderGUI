# SimplexDownloaderGUI

I originally made this program because I got really tired of having to use a link to download simplex lite.

So, I thought I'd spend 10 minutes in Visual Studio making a simple downloader to make it faster/easier to download. 

This application is practical, because if your computer BSODs, or tarkov crashes/dcs,

this simple utility makes it quite faster to download simplex lite.

This took 10 minutes to make, and is in its earliest stages. If people want me to, I can make a downloader for

all simplex releases, but lite is the version I use, so whatever.

Thanks for using.
